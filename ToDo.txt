TODO:
    Save
        - auto save
    Export
        - update export function
    Options
        - add Font, Font Size, export Save options
    Stats
        - add player information to sidebar
    Inventory 
        - add inventory box
    Library
        - write prompts for testing functionality
    NPC 
        - figure out npc and/or affinity behavior
    Other 
        - Expand Key Events Idea
        - Implement calendar
        - rename messageArchive.js to something more relevant

IDEAS:
    - Personality options that change choices or change how characters respond to you.
    - How will actions work? How will the calendar/timekeeping work?
        - Decrement action value until 0, then trigger "new day". This won't work with linear story progression as it's currently set up. 
        - Have a "world timer" that counts certain prompts towards incrementing then make certain choices avalible and/or have messages check world timer for queues. 
    - Key Events: when player makes story-significant choices, a boolean value is flipped, allowing prompts to check for them. (Add to player object?)
